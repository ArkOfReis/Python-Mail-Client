```

```
(EXTRAS)
To make the Mail work open the main.py in NotePad or an IDE
and change the Receiver_Email to the Email you want the message
to go to and change the Sender_Email to the Email you want to
send the Email with and then change Sender_Password to the
password of the Email you want to send the Email with.
If you are having problems log into your GMail and go to
https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps and enable it
and it will work!
